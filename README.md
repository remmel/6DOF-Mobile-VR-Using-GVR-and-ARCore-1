# 6DOF Mobile VR Using GVR and ARCore

## Fork
This project is a fork of https://github.com/rajandeepsingh13/6DOF-Mobile-VR-Using-GVR-and-ARCore project to be compatible with Unity 2019.4 LTS.

The differences are
- update to newer GVR and ARcore
- use of the package `Google VR Android` (Window > Package Manager)

## Original description
The project leverages ARCore and the Google Cardboard SDK to create an immersive VR experience in which the player can walk in with complete head tracking. This project was created in Unity 2018.2.10f1

The project files include a game, Teapot Dodge (APK can be found in the release section), to show its tracking capabilities. This project can be used as a reference as to how to leverage ARCore in Cardboard. If people are interested, I will upload a complete guide.
